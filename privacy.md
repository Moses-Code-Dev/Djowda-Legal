# Djowda Ecosystem Privacy Policy
_Last updated: [October 20, 2025]_

---

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to Djowda, an open, community-driven ecosystem designed to strengthen the food supply chain through transparent, decentralized technology. This Privacy Policy explains how Djowda and its ecosystem applications (collectively, the “Djowda Platform”) collect, use, and protect your personal and non-personal information.

We believe privacy is a fundamental right and treat all user data with respect, security, and minimalism — collecting only what is necessary to provide our services.

### 1.1 Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to all Djowda components, including (but not limited to) the Store, User, Farmer, Delivery, Factory, Wholesaler, Restaurant, Seed Provider, and Transport apps. All are collectively referred to as the “Djowda Components”.

### 1.2 Controller and Processor

Djowda operates as a platform connecting independent partners (e.g., stores, farmers, and delivery agents) with users.

The Djowda Project acts as the Data Controller for platform-level data, such as your account information, app analytics, and system logs.

Our partners (e.g., the store you order from) act as independent Data Controllers for the data they need to fulfill their service (e.g., your order details and delivery address).

In this context, the Djowda Platform acts as a Data Processor, securely passing your order information from you to the partner you have selected.

This Privacy Policy governs all data for which the Djowda Project is a Controller or Processor.

### 1.3 Commitment

Djowda does not sell or share user data for commercial purposes.

Data collection is transparent and purpose-limited.

Local data (on your device) remains under your control.

Where possible, data is anonymized or aggregated before transmission.

### 1.4 Policy Updates

This policy may be updated as Djowda grows or integrates new features. Changes will be reflected in the Privacy Policy repository (djowda-legal) and, when required, notified in-app before taking effect.

## 2. Scope of this Policy
This policy applies to all official Djowda applications and services, including but not limited to:

- Djowda Store  
- Djowda User  
- Djowda Delivery  
- Djowda Store Admin  
- Djowda Farmer  
- Djowda Factory  
- Djowda Restaurant  
- Djowda Seed Provider  
- Djowda Wholesaler

This Privacy Policy also applies to related backend systems, APIs, and websites owned or managed by Djowda, unless otherwise stated.

---

## 3. Information We Collect

Djowda is built around a local-first and privacy-by-design philosophy. We collect only the data necessary for the platform to function, ensuring transparency and user control across all components.

### 3.1 Categories of Information

#### a. Personal Information (User-Provided)

Depending on the component you use, Djowda may collect limited personal details that you voluntarily provide, such as:

Name or nickname

Phone number or email address (for account or order communication)

Delivery address or store location

Optional profile photo or avatar

Feedback or messages you submit through in-app forms

These details are used solely to enable app functionality (e.g., order delivery, communication, or user support).

#### b. Transactional Information

Information related to your interactions within the ecosystem:

Orders placed or received

Items added to cart or inventory

Order history, status updates, and payment confirmations

Store performance metrics (when you are a store owner or manager)

This information is stored locally or in Firebase Realtime Database under encrypted nodes tied to your user or store ID.

#### c. Device and App Information

To improve reliability and ensure security, Djowda may collect basic technical data:

Device model, OS version, and app version

Anonymous diagnostic logs and crash reports

Connectivity data (e.g., network status)

Approximate location or cell grid ID (for spatial features only — not precise GPS tracking)

All such data is used solely for app stability and location-based discovery within your subscribed area.

#### d.Location Information

Djowda collects two types of location data, depending on the app component and feature you are using:

Approximate Location: For general discovery (like finding nearby stores), we map your position to a grid cell ID using the minMax99 spatial system.

Precise Location Data (GPS): For components that require navigation, such as the Djowda Delivery and Djowda Transport apps, we collect real-time precise location data (GPS). This is essential for core features like delivery routing, calculating ETAs, and providing live order tracking to the user. This data is collected only with your explicit in-app consent.

### e. Information for Assistance Requests (Sensitive Data)

In certain app components, you may voluntarily provide information related to requests for food assistance or to identify yourself as part of a vulnerable population. This is considered Sensitive Data.

We collect this information only with your explicit consent and use it solely for the purpose of connecting you with food providers or support organizations within the Djowda ecosystem. This data is anonymized wherever possible and is never shared for advertising purposes.

#### f. Automatically Collected Non-Personal Data

Djowda may automatically process aggregated or anonymized information to improve performance and analytics, including:

Session statistics

Feature usage frequency

Regional activity heatmaps (without identifying any individual)

This helps us understand how different components are used and optimize system efficiency.

### 3.2 Special Note on Spatial Data

Djowda uses a custom grid-based spatial system to identify nearby stores or farms. This method:

Does not store or transmit precise GPS coordinates for general discovery.

Only maps your general position to a grid cell ID (approximately 500m²).

Ensures users and stores can interact locally without revealing exact locations.

This grid system is our primary method for spatial awareness. Components that require precise navigation, such as the Delivery App, will collect precise GPS data as stated in Section 3.1.d and with your explicit, in-app consent.

### 3.3 – Data Collected for Advertising or Funding

To sustain the ongoing development and maintenance of the Djowda ecosystem, certain components may include limited advertising modules such as Google AdMob or equivalent networks.

When these modules are active:

Advertising SDKs may collect anonymous identifiers (e.g., device advertising ID), general usage data, and approximate location to display relevant ads.

Users will be clearly informed and may choose to allow or limit personalized ads according to their preferences.

Djowda will always comply with the Google Play Data Safety and GDPR/CCPA consent requirements, ensuring you can manage your ad and privacy settings at any time.

Djowda does not sell personal information and does not share identifiable data with advertisers beyond what is required for ad delivery and measurement.

Where possible, ads may be disabled in community or educational builds to maintain a non-commercial environment.

---

## 4. How We Use Your Information
Djowda processes information with the sole purpose of providing a functional, safe, and sustainable ecosystem. We apply the principle of data minimalism — meaning we only use the information necessary to deliver a feature or service.

### 4.1 Service Functionality

We use collected data to:

Operate and maintain the Djowda platform and its components (e.g., store, user, farmer, delivery apps).

Process orders, transactions, and deliveries between users and stores.

Synchronize local and cloud data for real-time availability and communication.

Authenticate users and manage session security.

Personalize content such as localized offers or nearby store listings.

Each component processes only the data required for its intended purpose.

### 4.2 Communication

We may use limited contact details (such as phone number or email) to:

Send order updates, delivery confirmations, or support replies.

Notify you of important service changes or policy updates.

Respond to your feedback, bug reports, or data requests.

Djowda never uses your contact information for mass marketing without explicit consent.

### 4.3 Improvement and Research

Aggregated or anonymized data helps us:

Analyze system performance and user interaction patterns.

Detect issues and optimize app speed, stability, and resource use.

Improve spatial algorithms and matchmaking between stores, farmers, and users.

Guide feature prioritization while maintaining ethical data use.

All analytical processes respect privacy and avoid any personal identification.

### 4.4 Advertising and Funding

Some Djowda components may include non-intrusive ads to fund ongoing open-source and non-profit development.
When active:

Ads are delivered via trusted networks (e.g., Google AdMob) with explicit user consent.

You may opt out of personalized ads or disable ads entirely where supported.

Ad data (like device identifiers or region-level info) is never stored or reused by Djowda outside ad delivery.

Our goal is to ensure ads remain ethical, relevant, and optional.

### 4.5 Security and Fraud Prevention

We use system and network data to:

Prevent unauthorized access or abuse.

Detect fraud, spam, or misuse of platform components.

Enforce platform integrity and protect users and stores from malicious activity.

All logs and monitoring data are stored securely and automatically purged after operational use.

### 4.6 Legal and Compliance

We may process data when necessary to:

Comply with applicable laws, regulations, or court orders.

Cooperate with authorities in cases of verified misuse or fraud.

Fulfill user data requests under privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

---

## 5. Data Storage and Retention
Djowda follows a local-first and minimal retention philosophy. We store as little personal information as possible and only for as long as it’s needed to operate the platform or comply with legal obligations.

### 5.1 Local-First Design

Most user and store data is processed and stored locally on your device using secure, sandboxed databases (e.g., Room DB).
This ensures:

You maintain full control over your data.

Information such as cart items, order drafts, or preferences remain private unless shared by you.

Local data is deleted automatically when you uninstall the app or clear its storage.

### 5.2 Cloud Storage

When synchronization or communication between users, stores, or delivery agents is required, limited data is securely stored on Firebase Realtime Database or equivalent servers.

Cloud data includes:

Order details (IDs, status, timestamps)

Store availability and product listings

Delivery updates and transaction references

Account identifiers (user or store ID, hashed form)

All data is transmitted over encrypted channels (HTTPS/TLS) and stored under role-based access rules to prevent unauthorized access.

### 5.3 Data Retention Periods

Djowda retains data only for the minimum duration necessary to:

Complete a transaction or delivery.

Maintain accurate service logs for technical support.

Comply with regulatory or auditing requirements.

Typical retention timelines:

Data Type	Retention Duration	Deletion Trigger
Local user data (Room DB)	Until app removal or manual clear	User uninstall / clear data
Order records (Firebase)	30–90 days after order completion	Automatic cleanup
Error & crash logs	Up to 30 days	Auto purge
Communication metadata	90 days max	Auto purge
Account data	Until user deletion request	Immediate upon confirmation

### 5.4 User Control and Deletion

Users can request deletion of their cloud data at any time by:

Using in-app settings (where available), or

Contacting the Djowda data support team via the repository or official channel listed in Section 9.

Upon verification, all identifiable records associated with the request will be irreversibly deleted or anonymized within a reasonable timeframe.

### 5.5 Decentralized Data Integrity

Djowda’s architecture uses distributed components (e.g., MQTT and WebRTC communication layers) to enhance privacy and reduce centralized dependency.

Temporary communication data is held in memory only and not stored permanently.

Peer-to-peer exchanges (e.g., between nearby stores or users) are ephemeral by design.

Regular data pruning ensures no unnecessary information persists beyond its intended purpose.

---

## 6. Information Sharing and Disclosure
Djowda values user privacy and is committed to minimizing data sharing. We do not sell, rent, or exchange personal information for commercial gain.
Information is shared only when necessary to operate the platform, complete transactions, or comply with legal obligations.

### 6.1 Sharing Within the Djowda Ecosystem

Djowda is composed of interconnected components (Store, User, Farmer, Delivery, Factory, Restaurant, Wholesaler, Seed Provider, Transport).
Information may be shared between these components only when required for functionality, such as:

Sharing an order summary between a buyer app and a store app.

Sending delivery details to the assigned delivery agent.

Allowing farmers or wholesalers to view relevant transaction or logistics data.

All such exchanges occur over secured, authenticated channels, with each participant receiving only the minimum data necessary.

### 6.2 Third-Party Services

To support infrastructure and functionality, Djowda may use trusted third-party providers such as:

Firebase (Google LLC) — real-time database, authentication, and cloud messaging.

AdMob or similar networks — optional advertising modules.

Analytics services (if enabled) — for non-identifiable performance metrics.

Payment gateways — for secure financial transactions (where applicable).

Each third party operates under its own privacy policy and is contractually required to comply with applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Links to third-party policies are provided in Section 10 (References & Contacts).

### 6.3 Open Source and Community Contributions

As an open ecosystem, certain components of Djowda are publicly available under open-source licenses (AGPL or equivalent).
However:

Public code repositories contain no personal data.

Community contributions (e.g., bug reports or feedback) are voluntary and may be publicly visible on platforms like GitHub.

Users are advised not to share personal or sensitive data in open forums or public issue reports.

### 6.4 Legal Requirements

Djowda may disclose information when required by law, regulation, or valid legal request, including:

To comply with court orders or lawful government demands.

To investigate or respond to fraud, abuse, or misuse of the platform.

To protect the safety, rights, or property of users or the public.

Only the minimum data necessary will be disclosed, and where possible, users will be notified in advance unless prohibited by law.

### 6.5 Mergers or Organizational Changes

If Djowda’s management or operational structure changes (e.g., through transfer, merger, or creation of a foundation), user data may be transferred to the new responsible entity, provided:

The successor agrees to maintain equivalent or stronger privacy protections.

Users are notified and may choose to delete their data before the transition.

### 6.6 International Data Transfers

Data may be processed in countries where Djowda’s partners or servers are located.
When data is transferred across regions:

It is protected by industry-standard encryption.

Transfers comply with relevant data protection laws (e.g., GDPR adequacy, standard contractual clauses).

## 7. Data Security and Protection Measures

Djowda is built on a foundation of security-by-design and privacy-by-default principles.
We apply multiple layers of technical and organizational safeguards to protect all data handled within the ecosystem.

### 7.1 Encryption and Transmission Security

All communication between apps, servers, and components occurs over encrypted HTTPS/TLS connections.

Sensitive data (such as user IDs or store metadata) is stored in hashed or tokenized form whenever possible.

Temporary in-memory data (e.g., via MQTT or WebRTC sessions) is not persisted after session completion.

Encryption protocols follow industry best practices and are updated regularly to meet current standards.

### 7.2 Access Control and Authentication

Access to cloud databases is governed by Firebase Security Rules and role-based permissions, limiting who can read or write data.

Store managers, delivery agents, and users can access only the data relevant to their role or assigned task.

Administrative actions (such as store creation or configuration) require secure authentication tokens and verified credentials.

All system-level operations are logged and monitored for unauthorized attempts.

### 7.3 Local Data Protection

Local data stored via Room Database remains encrypted within Android’s protected sandbox environment.

No third-party apps can access this data without root-level privileges, which Djowda explicitly discourages and detects.

If your device supports hardware-level encryption (e.g., AES), Djowda automatically benefits from this security layer.

Clearing app storage or uninstalling the app permanently removes all locally held information.

### 7.4 Monitoring and Incident Response

Djowda continuously monitors for potential vulnerabilities or data breaches.

If a data breach is detected, affected users and authorities will be notified promptly in accordance with applicable laws.

Security patches and app updates are released regularly to maintain system integrity.

Reports of vulnerabilities from the open-source community are reviewed and addressed through transparent channels.

### 7.5 Data Minimization and Isolation

Each app component (Store, User, Farmer, etc.) operates within an isolated logical environment, minimizing cross-data exposure.

Only essential identifiers (like userId or storeId) are shared when needed for functionality.

Internal datasets are regularly audited and pruned to remove stale or unnecessary records.

### 7.6 Developer and Contributor Practices

All contributors to Djowda’s open-source code follow secure development guidelines, including version control protection, key obfuscation, and dependency auditing.

Sensitive configuration files (e.g., API keys) are never stored in public repositories.

Security reviews are conducted before each major release or Play Store submission.

### 7.7 User Responsibility

While Djowda provides robust protection mechanisms, users are encouraged to:

Use secure devices with updated operating systems.

Avoid sharing account credentials or sensitive data through unofficial channels.

Report any suspected vulnerabilities or data misuse to the official Djowda contact address listed in Section 10.
